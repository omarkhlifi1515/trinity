Update on Project Trinity's Direction

Following a deep review of our progress, I’ve decided to make a radical change to the project structure. We are shifting focus from a strict "Attack & Defense" model to a broader development ecosystem involving Web, Mobile, and AI Automation (n8n).

The Reason for the Change: I realized there was a methodological error in my approach. I was trying to force security as the core purpose of the project, which felt unnatural. Security should be an integrated element, not the sole axis. Building a flawed system just to demonstrate attack vectors limits our ability to identify genuine architectural issues.

The New Structure: We are transitioning to a three-part ecosystem:

Trinity Web

Trinity Mobile

Trinity Agent

I believe this is the right path forward. If anyone has any issues or feedback, please contact me directly.
