# MobileTrinity - Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose) Starter

This folder contains a minimal Android project skeleton for a Jetpack Compose app using Kotlin. Open this folder in Android Studio (recommended) to build and run.

Notes
- The skeleton is minimal and intended to be imported into Android Studio. The Gradle wrapper is not included; use your local Gradle or let Android Studio set it up.
- Open `mobiletrinity` in Android Studio and run the `app` module.
